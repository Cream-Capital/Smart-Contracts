# Smart-Contracts

A collection of Smart Contracts designed to be used in the Cream Capital ecosystem

**CreamCash** - intendeed to be a highly transactable uncapped stable cryptocurrency 

**Cream** - a capped growth driven token; it will be heavily promoted and incentivised in our ATM network and our other systems in order to return the value back to the holders. It server also as a way to promote the adoption of Cream Cash through a staking mechanism which rewards holders with Cream

Both Cream and Cream Cash are **ERC223** tokens which solve a couple of problems of the standard ERC20 tokens such as losing the tokens forever if they are sent to a contract that is not designed to handle them and the impossibility of handling incoming transactions in receiver contract, due to this both of the tokens can behave just like Ether, developers could easily integrate them in their contracts, even run ICOs with them as long as they implement the ContractReceiver interface.** 

**CDAX** or Cream Digital Asset Exchange is a way of purchasing Cream Cash with Ether. It's also designed to stabilize the price of Cream Cash.
 
Work In Progress: Cream Cash, CDAX and writting tests for them as well as the ICO contract.
